# Graph Algorithms CLI

This project is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) program for working with graphs. It provides a comprehensive set of functionalities to manipulate graphs, analyze their properties, and solve algorithmic problems. The program implements several advanced graph algorithms such as **Floyd-Warshall**, **TSP**, **DAG**, **BFS**, and more. 

## Features

The program includes the following functionalities accessible through a user-friendly CLI:

### Graph Management
- **View graph details**: Get the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
- **Print graph**: List all vertices, edges, and their associated costs.
- **Check edges**: Determine whether an edge exists between two vertices.
- **Vertex and edge operations**:
  - Add or remove vertices.
  - Add or remove edges with specified costs.
- **Degree information**: Compute the in-degree and out-degree of a given vertex.
- **Inbound and Outbound edges**:
  - Parse and display the inbound edges for a vertex.
  - Parse and display the outbound edges for a vertex.

### Graph Algorithms
- **Shortest Path**:
  - Compute the shortest path between two vertices using **BFS**.
- **Lowest Cost Walk**:
  - Find the lowest-cost walk between vertices using advanced graph algorithms.
- **Floyd-Warshall**:
  - Use the **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.
- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**:
  - Find solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
- **DAG Analysis**:
  - Perform operations specific to Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

### Additional Features
- **Graph I/O**:
  - Read graph data from a file.
  - Write graph data to a file.
- **Generate random graphs**:
  - Create random graphs with a specified number of vertices and edges.
- **Copy graph**:
  - Create a deep copy of the current graph.
